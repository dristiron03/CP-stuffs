->  Every integer expressible as product of distinct primes, raised to a natural power. 
    Let p be prime, x be exponent.

->  The number of factors of n = product of(x+1).
    Because there are (x+1) ways to chose the prime.
    This product is also Tau(n).

->  The sum of factors of n = Product of(1+p+p^2+..+p^(x)), for all primes.
    Also called the (Sigma) function.

->  The prodcut of factors of n = n^(Tau(n)/2).
    Every factor of n, < n/2 , will have corresponding part > n/2.
    Which is indeed (Tau(n)/2).

->  Let n be a perfect number.
    Implies, n = Sigma(n)-n.
    Example ->  28 is a perfect number.
                28 = 1+2+4+7+14
    
->  Let Pie(n), denote the number of primes, between 1 to n.
    Pie(10) = 4
    Pie(n) is approximately (n/ln(n)).

Conjectures involving primes-----
    Goldbachs conjecture: 
        Each even integer n>2, can be represented as a sum of two primes.

    Twin prime conjecture: 
        There are infinite number of primes of the form {p, p+2}.

    Legendre's conjecture:
        There is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2.
