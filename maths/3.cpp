->  Diophantine equations:
    Any equation, ax+by = c has solution, iff gcd(a,b) | c.
    if (x1, y1) is a solution, all other solutions are of the form of
        (x1 + (ka)/gcd(a,b), y1-(ka)/gcd(a,b)), for all k belongs to Z. 

-> Chinese Remainder Theorem:
    

-> Lagranges Theorem:
    Every positive integer can be represented as a sum of four squares. 
    123 = 8^2+5^2+5^2+3^2

-> Zeckendorf's theorem:
    Every positive integer has a unique representation as a sum of Fibonacci numbers such that no
    two numbers are equal or consecutive fibs. 
    74 = 55+13+5+1
    Choose fibs greedily to form the required number.

-> Euclid's formula:
    All primitive Pythagorean triples are of the form,
    (n^2-m^2, 2*n*m, n^2+m^2), where (n,m)=1.

-> Wilsons Theorem:
    A number n is prime iff (n-1)!(mod n) = -1.
